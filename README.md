Repository dedicated to homeworks for VARTO School “Game Developer” courses. Unity Engine – 3D – URP

What I have learned while doing those homeworks:
  1) Unity Input System
  2) Wokring with light, backing light, light and reflection probes
  3) Particle System
  4) Animation and Audio systems
  5) NavMesh Surface, Agents and Modificators (such as obstacle, volume)
  6) Post processing, global and local volumes. Graphics draw calls inspection.

Key point to remember:
  - Homework 7 and 6 are not listed in final project, because they were made as part of C# section.
  - Each Branch is separate homework
  - Code within repository is not a final/playable project
  - Code style or patterns are NOT personal preferences, some parts of the project were done specifically to satisfy an assignment
  - Homework repositories DO NOT follow Git WorkFlow, rather Feature Branch style
